tidy.id: tidier parking!

## About

tidy.id plans to make a faster and more secure parking system by using a web-based login interface, number-plate to account assigning, and many more.

We also aim to make parking a better experience by:
 - Assuring users that their personal transportation is secure.
 - Providing live information of the parking lot's capacity. 
 - Providing peak hours data.
 - A lost-and-found dedicated webpage and announcements.

*all features are still in development and is prone to change.*
